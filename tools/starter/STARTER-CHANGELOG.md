# <!--name:STARTER_NAME-->Anzuelo<!--/name--> changelog

Changes to the starter itself. A project picks up engine changes with `node tools/starter.mjs upgrade` (or, from the
starter, `node tools/new-project.mjs "<project>" --upgrade`). Rule and runbook changes listed here are adopted by hand
(project-rule, runbook-create), because an upgrade never touches a project's own content.

- 2026-10-19 (later): Fixes from the same project's next upgrade.
  - **No false "kept your edited version".** An older shipped check is not a local edit. The starter now ships
    `tools/hooks/engine-checks-history.json`, the fingerprint of every version of every check it ever released
    (backfilled from git history, grown by sync). A project entry equal to any of them is refreshed, even in a project
    from before `engine-checks.json` existed, and so is one an older upgrade wrongly marked `"custom"`. The `pack` and
    `skill` labels older releases didn't write no longer count as differences. To take the newer version of a check
    you did edit, replace the entry with the one in `engine-checks.json` (removing `"custom"` alone kept it again).
  - **Lessons survive a runbook becoming engine-owned.** Lines a project wrote under `## Pitfalls` of an engine runbook
    or core skill (lines in neither the new file nor any shipped version of it) move to its `## Project lessons`
    section, and the upgrade review lists the file. Before, `project.md` turning engine-owned dropped them silently.
  - **A stale mirror is refreshed.** A skills folder the engine generated (its skills carry `.mirror`) stays a mirror
    even when it is missing from `skillMirrors`, so it is synced, pruned and protected; one left out kept a link that
    pointed one folder short.
  - **A runbook can own folders.** `owns: sources/raids/**` in a runbook's frontmatter: in a turn that follows it,
    another runbook's trigger skips files there, so research downloads don't call for ingest. In any other turn the
    trigger still fires.
  - The mirror-link self-test looks only at its own fixture's links, so a project's own runbooks (whose content the
    test base removes) no longer fail it.

- 2026-10-19: Fixes from a real project's upgrade.
  - **Pack and library checks are upgraded too.** `tools/hooks/engine-checks.json` now ships every check: the core
    skills', each pack's (tagged `pack`) and each library skill's (tagged `skill`). An upgrade runs the same 3-way merge
    on the checks of the packs the project installed and the library skills it enabled: missing ones are added with
    their `docs/checks/rule-enforcement.md` rows, unedited ones are refreshed, edited ones are kept and marked
    `"custom": true`, and the upgrade review lists every added check. Switching a check off and the app pack's own code
    folders and version file count as settings, not edits. Before, the live hooks skipped new pack and library checks
    that the self-tests ran.
  - **Skill mirrors keep working links.** A mirror (`.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, any `skillMirrors` entry) sits
    at a different depth than `skills/`, so its Markdown links are re-pointed from the mirror's folder to the same
    target. Links inside the skill's own folder and code stay as they are, and the audit compares mirrors the same way.
  - **The engine's runbooks are upgraded.** `docs/playbooks/project.md` was in neither upgrade list, so projects kept
    an old copy with unlabeled "Done when" items and done-when-labeled fired on it. `project.md` and `plan.md` are now
    engine files like `_fallback.md` and `_TEMPLATE.md`: replaced on upgrade, keeping the project's added triggers, its
    `## Project lessons` section and its `hardened`, `harden` and `keep` marks (older copy in `.cache/upgrade-backup/`).
  - **No plain-writing alarm on short answers.** A 2-line progress answer whose first line had no final period ran into
    the markers line and was measured as one 47-word sentence. Length now counts prose only: the answer's markers line
    (`Playbook:`, `Skill:`, `Worth it:`, `N/A(...)`), code spans and file paths are left out, and an answer under 40
    words is never too long. Em dashes and filler are still caught everywhere.
  - **See every check a scenario trips at once.** `node tools/hooks/selfcheck.mjs --explain "<scenario name>"` runs the
    matching scenarios and prints each check that fires, with its short label, what satisfies it and how to waive it,
    so a project writing pass scenarios fixes them in one go instead of one stop round at a time.

- 2026-10-18: Runbooks and skills come up when the work needs them, not only when the request names them.
  - **Event triggers.** What the agent did now makes a runbook or skill mandatory, even if nobody asked. Code written
    for sign-in, passwords, tokens, secrets, permissions, sessions, CORS, uploads, endpoints, shell or eval, query
    building, crypto, payments or personal data needs the security review (security-code). So do `.env`, CI, Docker
    and hosting changes (security-config), and publish or deploy commands, which now wait for the review before they
    run (security-publish). A test or build that failed and was then fixed needs its root cause (debug-trigger), and
    two or more sub-agents need their results checked together (parallel-trigger). Library skills and packs got their
    own: accessibility for screen changes, MCP server code, dependencies and schemas (architecture), production down
    (incident-response), numbers from data files, privacy policies and contracts, migrations (data-change), version
    tags (release), installers (install-update), new originals (ingest), outputs (deliverable) and facts written into
    the knowledge base. The full matrix, with what stays judgment and why, is in `docs/checks/rule-enforcement.md`.
  - **Told early, not only at the end.** The prompt hook prints `MUST FOLLOW: <skill>` when the request shows the
    event coming ("add a login page"), and the edit hook prints it the moment an edit writes what a trigger watches,
    once per turn. The security waivers need a real reason of a few words. New check conditions: `changedContentMatches`
    (what this turn added to the changed files, from the agent's own edits, capped), `anyOf`, `filesIgnore`,
    `ranFailing`, `toolCount` and `guiChanged`; a check names what it makes mandatory with `forces` and its prompt hint
    with `hint`.
  - **Stop rounds no longer alternate.** The first round lists every step, including the lesson for a skill whose own
    check failed. A waiver, a `Playbook:` or `Skill:` marker, or a Finished section written in an earlier message of
    the turn still counts (the Finished section only while no file changed after it).
  - **Upgrades keep checks you edited.** The core checks ship as `tools/hooks/engine-checks.json`. An upgrade refreshes
    an entry only when it still equals the copy shipped last time; an entry edited in the project stays, is marked
    `"custom": true` and goes into the upgrade review.
  - **Fixes from real projects.** A sub-agent prompt may name a brief file that tells it to read AGENTS.md. "Without my
    input" or "don't ask me" prompts a hint to set `"autonomy": "auto"` and record it, after which the fit row passes
    as add. The writing check skips scripts, styles and template literals in pages, and treats image, link-only and
    table lines as their own blocks. `tools/hooks/project-scenarios.mjs` may use fixture names. A new runbook or skill
    that only this project could have says `reuse: none - project-specific: <why>` instead of a skill search, and new
    hand-written skills need the search too. The gui pack saves click-through flows as `docs/checks/flows/<page>.json`,
    `screenshot.mjs --flows --pages <page>` reruns them, and gui-flows asks for it when that page changes. Key prefixes
    such as `sk-` count as secrets only at the start of a word. The user-words check skips engine files and relayed
    agent or session messages. `dedupe.mjs` keeps the copy the project refers to (else the better name, then the
    oldest), never deletes a referenced copy, skips folders written in the last 10 minutes, and takes `--path`.
    `claims.mjs new --slug <topic>` lets helpers on one topic share a ledger. A file created during this turn in an
    originals folder may be deleted again. The self-tests strip a real project's own content from their sandbox, and a
    scenario that judges nothing fails with a hint.
- 2026-10-18: Upgrades and additions can't make a project worse unseen.
  - **A calm display when the checks ask for more, used where the agent's host documents it.** Claude Code (it sets
    `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` for its hooks) gets the steps as feedback for the agent instead of an error, plus one short
    line for the user (an anchor, the starter's name, then `2 steps left before done: ...`), and the session and prompt
    notices as hidden context. Codex (its hook input has `turn_id`) documents no non-error way to continue a turn, so
    it keeps the classic block, with the same short line as its documented user message. Any other host gets the
    classic block. `"stopStyle"` in `tools/hooks/config.json` is `auto` (the default), `feedback` or `block`. Agents
    without hooks get the same short steps from `hooks.mjs check`, followed by the full ones. Not verified in a live
    Codex session: whether Codex also shows the block's reason to the user.
  - **Answers cite like a research assistant, and more "Done when" items are checked.** Research answers end each fact
    with a numbered citation `[1]`, `[2]` and close with a `Sources:` list, one `[n] <link or project file>` line per
    number (research-cited blocks a bare link list and a number with no line; answer-traced ignores citation numbers).
    Longer research turns show short activity lines (`🔍 search: ...`, `📖 read: ...`). New checks: debug-test-added
    (code fixed with the debug skill needs a test change, or an N/A when there is no test framework), security-logged
    (a full security review is logged in `docs/security.md`), skill-compared (a third-party skill brought in passes
    `skills.mjs compare`), incident-root-cause and history-hashes (library skills), release-rollback (app pack), and
    plan-open now has its own tag. A "Done when" label may wrap over several lines and name several tags.
  - **The fit checklist: the AI decides every candidate, the user only sees a summary.** `node tools/fit.mjs` keeps
    `docs/fit-checklist.md` in each project: one row per pack, library skill, recommended tool and optional feature
    (Obsidian vault, git hooks, autonomy auto, recall and memory, plans), each decided add, skip or "later - when:
    <condition>" with a reason. `node tools/fit.mjs check` (fit-checklist) fails a "?", a boilerplate or copied
    reason, an "add" that is not really in the project, a "skip" that ignores what the survey found (web, data, git,
    code, Python files and more), and a "later" without a condition or whose condition is already met. Setup, the
    upgrade review ("fit: N new candidates") and the audit wait for FIT: PASS; the session start announces a measurable
    "later" once it comes due. Setup no longer asks the user about each library skill: only choices that cost money,
    touch privacy or act outside the project go to the user. `fit.mjs decide` and `fit.mjs summary` record decisions
    and print "Added: ... Skipped: ... Later: ...". `tools/survey.mjs` now reads its counts from the engine
    (`projectSurvey`).
  - **compress-for-ai** shortens notes between helper agents and, on request, answers too; its check accepts
    `protect-check.mjs <before> <after>` for agent notes.
  - **Found in a real project, and fixed** (each has a self-test now):
    - Routing needs real evidence: triggers made only of common words ("fix it", "i added") never route, a phrase with
      one key word needs a second one, and questions asking the agent's opinion route nowhere.
    - Pasted text (`<pasted_content>`) and the hooks' own output pasted back are not the request: they don't route and
      don't count for counts, `qa-incident` or any `promptMatches` check.
    - The prompt hook says each notice once per turn, not with every message typed mid-turn. Last turn's misses are
      said once, then dropped. Checks marked `"waitsForAgents": true` are never carried over.
    - After the last allowed block, Stop ends quietly and the misses carry over in plain words (checked, kept).
    - Editing a runbook or skill is maintaining it, not following it. `skill-learn` asks for a lesson only when a
      followed runbook's or skill's own check failed earlier in the turn, never for a wording check.
    - Files changed by background helpers that are still running are not the main turn's changes.
    - The self-tests pass inside a project mid-setup: their sandbox drops the project's own fit checklist, plans and
      hook state, and uses the starter's current core skill checks when the starter can be reached. The merge and
      citation checks wait for background helpers even in a project whose checks predate `"waitsForAgents"`.
    - A fit "later - when:" condition counts what its noun names ("raid files" are files with "raid" in the path,
      "html files" end in .html, "commits" is the git history); one it can't read is not measured, and the sweeps
      revisit it.
    - A file rewritten byte for byte is not a change (the prompt hook keeps each file's hash at the turn's start), and
      build outputs (`buildOutputs` in config) are generated, not GUI changes.
    - Gates are judged by their own result: their pass line, or their exit code when run as their own command.
      `packs.mjs configure app` takes `--build-pass` and `--test-pass`.
    - Numbers the agent wrote into files earlier in the session are not flagged as made up.
    - A quoted list in Markdown is a list, not one long paragraph.
    - A change to `requirements.json` or `config.json` needs only the scenarios of the checks it touched
      (`selfcheck.mjs --tags a,b`), or none for tuning such as a `namesIgnore` glob. The full self-test is for hook code.
    - `DIRECTORY.md` has one short line per runbook and skill; the descriptions live in each file.
    - `new-project.mjs --dry-run` prints a summary and the collisions; `--verbose` lists every file.
    - `hooks.mjs sync` deletes files from skill mirrors that are gone from the skill.
    - Environment names use `STARTER_` (the old `KS_` names still work for one release).
    - The memory folder for rule notes is agent-neutral: `memoryDir` in config, else Claude Code's folder when Claude
      Code runs the hooks, else `tools/hooks/state/memory/` (ignored by git).
    - Engine lessons travel back: `starter.mjs feedback "<text>"` and `starter.mjs report`; the starter's audit warns
      about unreviewed lines in `docs/feedback-inbox/`; `starter.mjs status` says how far the starter is behind.
    - The Finished section is asked for only when real work files changed, not engine state or a helper's files.
    - Wordings the writing standards require word for word are not counted as copies of the user's words.
    - The Stop message shows one short line per step; `node tools/hooks/hooks.mjs why` prints the full steps.
  - **Messages show their kind in the terminal:** "In the terminal" in `docs/checks/writing-standards.md` gives
    each block a bold lead word (`Question for you:`, `Done:`, `Heads-up:`, `Problem:`), keeps questions last and
    lines short. `audit.mjs` and `trial.mjs` color PASS, FAIL and WARN at a terminal (plain when piped or `NO_COLOR`).
  - **Renamed Anzuelo** (after the hooks that hold the agent to its work). "Roe" is also an
    AI agent company. The name lives only in `docs/names.json`.
  - **Upgrade guard:** an upgrade audits and times the project before and after. A check that passed before and fails
    after rolls it all back (`--accept-findings` keeps it and lists them to fix).
  - **Upgrade review:** every new hard rule, every pack or library skill that fits the setup answers and was never
    decided, every new failing check and every much slower hook goes into `docs/DECISIONS.md` to adopt (with "Worth
    it") or decline (with the reason), plus a passing self-test run. The hooks hold work until it is done
    (upgrade-review).
  - **Speed budget:** `node tools/hooks/hooks.mjs bench` times the hooks; the audit fails when one is over
    `hookBudgetMs` (1000 ms).
  - Fixed: making a project filled the placeholders inside the engine's own code (it now fills docs and data only).
  - **One research skill** replaces web-search and the knowledge pack's research and answer-question runbooks, with
    a section per situation: from the project's files, a quick lookup, full research, and recording. Full research
    uses a ledger (`claims.mjs`): every source screened for paid or biased content, claims confirmed only by
    independent owners. Checks: research-verified, research-ledger, research-cited, and answer-traced ("did I make
    that up?": every number in a factual answer or written into the knowledge base appears in something read that
    turn, and every cited project file was opened). Upgrades retire web-search and offer to merge the old runbooks.
  - **Only improvements, never friction:** hard rule 18. A runbook, skill or check that preceded the user's
    frustration in 3 of its last 6 turns is suspended and announced (friction-suspend); safeguards are flagged
    instead. `hooks.mjs restore <item>` brings one back. A pending upgrade review blocks once a day at most.
  - **Recall:** finished work turns are remembered locally; a similar request gets a RECALL hint, and
    `node tools/recall.mjs` searches past work and the project's records (recall-hint).
  - **Autonomy:** `"autonomy": "auto"` (or `new-project.mjs --auto`) runs without questions: setup records assumed
    answers, the agent decides the upgrade review. Outward actions and third-party installs still need an OK.
  - **Obsidian:** a core obsidian skill and `notes.mjs` (links, backlinks, suggestions, orphans, open in Obsidian). New
    notes link to related notes (note-linked); new projects get `.obsidian/app.json` for markdown links; the audit
    warns about orphans, and the starter maps every one of its files.
  - **Safety and size:** kept files may not carry hidden instructions or invisible characters (injection-guard); the
    audit warns when the files loaded every session grow past `alwaysLoadedMaxChars`.
  - **.gitignore before every push** (gitignore-ready): the pretool hook, the git pre-push hook and the audit check
    that secrets, local state, caches and private files are ignored, that what the project needs is not, and that
    nothing ignored is already committed. Projects get it from the engine; upgrades add `.codex/` to their ignores.
  - **No vendor files in git:** the rules live in `AGENTS.md`. `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/` and `.codex/` are made on each
    machine by `node tools/hooks/wire.mjs` (new projects and upgrades run it) and ignored by git. Upgrades don't
    force this on projects that already commit `CLAUDE.md`.
  - **Setup understands the project first, and speaks plainly:** `node tools/survey.mjs` reads the folder (documents,
    earlier AI instructions, code, data) before any question. Question 0 asks how involved the user wants to be: let
    the AI decide everything, only the important questions, or everything. Every choice is offered in plain words
    (what it does, what you'll notice) with "Let the AI decide" as an option; packs and library skills carry that
    wording, and the audit requires it. The upgrade review uses the same wording.
  - **Questions anyone can answer:** "Questions with choices" in `docs/checks/writing-standards.md`: plain names, what
    each option does, why it is good or bad for THIS project (judged by where it is heading), every technical word
    explained, numbers in everyday terms, one decision per question, and "Let the AI decide". Packs and library skills
    carry "Good when" and "Costs" lines (the audit requires them). The app foundation is asked row by row.
  - **Better or worse?** `docs/checks/better-or-worse.md` lists the questions to answer before adding anything, each
    tied to the check that answers it. Hard rule 16 links it.
  - **Trial (starter only):** `node tools/trial.mjs` builds sample projects (empty, notes and data, a node app with
    git, its own rules, secrets and Husky hooks, a python app), runs new, adopt and two upgrades, and proves every
    promise: no user file changed, rules kept, secrets ignored, the project's tests and git hooks still work, no
    commit made, nothing private leaked, hooks within budget, a second upgrade changes nothing. `audit --full` runs it.
  - **Found by the trial and in a real adoption, and fixed:**
    - wiring switched off a project's own git hooks (Husky, or hooks in `.git/hooks`); they are now kept, and the
      audit warns until they call ours;
    - the audit failed adopted projects for rules files that setup merges later (now warnings until setup);
    - the setup gate counted the instruction "Replace every `<...>`" as an unfilled value;
    - app tests failed in projects whose code lives outside `src/`;
    - four-part version numbers were flagged as IP addresses;
    - a project named after its subject (a game) had every mention flagged: `"_subjects"` in `docs/names.json`;
      setup answers written with a name marker stopped counting;
    - writing "starter.mjs link" into a file with a heredoc was blocked as if it ran.
  - **Development copies:** a `.starter-dev` file marks a copy being worked on. Projects can't be made from it or
    linked to it (`--dev` for throwaway tests), so unfinished changes never reach real projects. In it, the app
    pack's gates apply to the starter itself: self-tests, this changelog, the trial, and a verification line.
  - **Plans that outlive the session:** a work turn that adds 5+ files needs a plan in `docs/plans/`
    (plan-required); unfinished plans are announced at every session start, for any agent, until closed with
    `status: done` or `status: dropped - <why>`. The plan skill gained context, checks per task, a confidence
    score, "How to resume" and `plan-tasks.mjs next`. The starter's own plans never ship to projects.
  - **Recommended tools:** `docs/recommended-tools.md` lists 47 optional tools (Playwright, status lines, linters,
    secret scanners, Pillow for marking up screenshots, data tools and more), each with when to recommend it, when
    to skip it, pros, costs, license and the official install command. Setup recommends only what improves the project.
  - **New skills, merged from imported plugins (all rewritten in our words, credited, Apache-2.0 or MIT):**
    - library: architecture (decisions, system design, tech debt), incident-response, data-analysis (with a
      zero-install `profile.mjs`), legal-review (never legal advice), marketing;
    - frontend-design now also critiques, keeps a design system, writes interface text, reviews accessibility
      (WCAG 2.2 AA) and writes developer handoffs; research gained research with people (interviews, surveys);
    - debug, plan (PRP-style context and checks), session-handoff (to-dos, standups, a glossary in
      `docs/glossary.md`), skill-harden (share skills as a bundle, `bundle-check.mjs`), and the app pack's qa
      (code review, test planning), release (deploy checklist, rollback) and feature (docs) runbooks;
    - the knowledge pack's deliverable runbook gained a prose review.
  - **Requirements enforce themselves:** a lasting requirement the user states ("every picture must have a diagram")
    is enforced in the same turn without being asked: a "Done when" item that names its check, the check and its test,
    or "(judgment: <why>)" when no script can tell (requirement-enforced). Every "Done when" item in a runbook or skill
    changed in a turn says how it is proven (done-when-labeled; older ones get an audit warning). An answer may not end
    by offering to add checks, runbooks, tests or skills instead of adding them (self-improve).
  - **Update from GitHub:** `node tools/starter.mjs update` gets the newest starter into the linked copy (it stops if
    that copy has local changes or is a development copy), then upgrades the project the safe way.
  - **Docs checked for accuracy and compression:** every Markdown file was checked against the code (8 fixes, e.g.
    project test scenarios belong in `tools/hooks/project-scenarios.mjs`, which upgrades keep). The 82 AI-facing files
    were tried at the light compression level with the protect check: none changed, since each would shrink under 5%
    (they are already short; most of their length is commands, tags and tables that must not change).
  - **Commercial use:** every skill's license must allow commercial use without copyleft (audit), and the weighing
    in hard rule 16 includes the license. New library skill: teach (our own, original wording).

- 2026-10-17: Named Roe. Complete setup, a gui pack, security for every project, self-improving skills.
  - **Setup gates:** the user answers the setup questions before anything is installed (setup-interview). The answers
    are recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and the packs must match them. Every library skill that fits is enabled or
    left out with the user's reason, before the starter's leftovers go (setup-complete).
  - **gui pack:** the GUI runbook, review loop, screenshot tool and visual checklist moved out of the core into a pack,
    with the frontend-design skill. A project that changes GUI files without it is asked to add it (gui-pack).
    Upgrading a project that had the GUI runbook adds the pack.
  - **Security for every project:** `docs/security.md` in every project, set during setup. security-review is a core
    skill that covers private data, untrusted content and downloads too. Hard rule 15.
  - **Skills improve and stay lean:** a miss while following a runbook or skill writes the lesson into it
    (skill-learn). Runbooks and skills unused for 60 days are announced (skill-prune) and curated with the new
    skill-curate skill; `node tools/skills.mjs retire <name>` removes one with its checks and menu code.
  - **Only what makes it better:** hard rule 16. A new skill, pack or dependency needs "Worth it: <gain> / <cost>"
    (worth-it).
  - **References sweep:** the audit fails when a doc names a file, command or skill that does not exist.
  - Removed `tools/skills.mjs prune-library` (it skipped the setup checks; `tools/starter.mjs` replaces it).
  - **New library skills:** commit-archaeologist (why code exists, from its git history) and compress-for-ai (shorter
    AI-facing files, with a check that nothing was lost).
  - **Found by an end-to-end test in real projects, and fixed:**
    - a fake key in a test file made every project's first full commit fail the secret check (the audit now fails
      on any secret-shaped string);
    - the self-tests failed inside finished projects (they now start from a neutral copy);
    - an upgrade overwrote lessons a project wrote into core skills (it now keeps their triggers and a
      "## Project lessons" section, and backs up every replaced file);
    - two app pack check patterns had lost their backslashes and could never pass (a test now guards all patterns,
      and upgrades repair old copies);
    - agents without hooks could install packs before the interview (the tools now check it themselves);
    - the brief template's guidance counted as answers, typical requests were misread, dates used UTC, edited
      runbooks looked new, and routing needed the exact phrase (now key words in any order also match).
  - **Every name is a variable:** hard rule 17. Names live once in `docs/names.json`; docs show them in
    `<!--name:KEY-->` markers that sync refills, code reads the file, and a check catches names typed out elsewhere
    (name-var). Setup sets PROJECT_NAME; upgrades add the file with the project's current name.
  - `.gitattributes` keeps line endings the same on every machine.

- 2026-10-17: First release.
  - **Core:**
    - a hook engine for session start, every prompt, before and after tool calls, and stop;
    - a baseline of checks that can't be switched off by editing a file;
    - declarative project checks (`toolPassed`, `runEach` and more).
  - **Routing:** a generated `DIRECTORY.md`, and every runbook with a generated skill and a required check.
  - **Agents:** works with any agent (hooks for Claude Code and Codex; `begin` / `check` for the rest).
  - **Packs:** knowledge and app, chosen during setup, with a purity check.
  - **Setup:** a setup prompt that deletes itself only after verification, and an adopt path for existing projects.
  - **Safety:** git guards (no AI attribution, no secrets, backups before history rewrites, protected branches), a
    browser guard, originals and outputs protected, people's data kept apart.
  - **Quality:** a GUI screenshot loop, plain writing, principles instead of the user's literal examples, a tidy
    layout, an app foundation (security, performance budgets, usability).
  - **Skills:** core skills for every project (plan, debug, parallel-agents, web-search, skill-finder) and a library
    picked during setup (security-review, security-hardening, backend-patterns, frontend-design, codebase-map,
    repo-setup, orchestrate, mcp-builder). Each one is our own rewrite of an open-source skill: it covers everything

  - **Skills are first-class:** a skill that is not part of a runbook routes by its own `triggers:` (`SKILL:` hint),
    must be opened when matched (skill-read), and proves its "Done when" with its own check (`skillUsed`). Library
    skills bring their checks when enabled and take them away when disabled.
  - **Tests:** 200 hook self-tests and ablation tests (every required step of a golden workflow must be load-bearing).
  - **Found in live testing:** the Stop hook must read the final answer from the agent, because the transcript lags
    behind. Generated files must not count as the agent's edits. An emptied checks file must not disable the baseline.
